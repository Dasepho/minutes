# Kickstart 2018 Retrospective

## Future kickstart Discussion
- Mini games. Run a smaller competition at kickstart, with interuption from calendar

## Organisation of the day
- Talks were far too short, had an hour to fill
- Rehersal for presentations
- Schedue wasn't stuck to especially well
- Radios are useful for instant communication, or announcements
- Make sure teams know _where_ events were happening
- Have a single person responsible for organising events on the day
- Micro games were disjointed, stolen from SR very late in the game
- Micro games were done too quickly, very bad quality
- Micro games docs should have a history / latest version (google drive / git)
- Lots of people dont have access to drive
- Sharing persistant information to new people is an issue
- Communication with people greeting teams was an issue, they didnt know when it all started
- Contingency plans are a good idea, eg for underrunning talks
- Tours are good for student intake
- reherse the competition
    - post-competition

## Project Management and Ownership
- Trello isnt good for showing priority cards
- Referencing other tickets (for dependency) in Trello isnt really possible
- Code ownership is missing
- Have a list of what kind of thing should go on what platform
- Issues with people not having access to the right information, left behind, unused resources
- New starters should be told where things are
- Clearer ownership of major areas
- Trello isnt really working, not sure what the best solution is, or what it would look like
- Trac is a bit shit, but might work?
- Action (Tyler): Research into possible solutions, and how to use it. To review in Jan

## Collaboration
- Coordinator per task, _not_ an owner. Supervise task running
- Maybe seperate hardware and software, theyre different
- Using a single tool for things isnt ideal, play to specialities
- Seperation of kit development and usage
- Owning sections
    - Kit (manufacturing, design, software) (_producer not director_)
    - Events (kickstart, comp, tech days)
    - Public facing side
    - Teams (bundle with above?)

- Action (Peter): Create document specifying roles for tasks, who does what

## Kit Issues
- Kit setup isnt very mature
- Should be resolved in time
- Avoiding scope creep is good
- Prioritisation isnt the best, but we've only built things when we need them
- Coping with failure isnt great
- Kit development isnt very good without an actual kit
- No 1 person has been thinking about the kit as a whole
- Some kind of technical lead for checking compatability / overview
- Best way to test a full system is test a full system!
- Money is easy to get, volunteer time is not


## Contracts can be copyrighted

## Clarity what our liabilities are regarding kit
