# SourceBots Agenda 2018-06-18

- Student Robotics Meeting next weekend
    - Who can attend?
        - Dan cannot.
    - As some people cannot attend in person, it's really important that:
        - There is very very detailed minutes
            - Suggestion: Two people separately take minutes
                - Jake will minute at https://hackmd.io/kqF0TNogSLmeIcNpGclooA# (also post questions here)
        - There is a good setup for video conferencing, decent mic and camera
            - Jake will bring a good webcam, good mic and good speaker, all external.
        - We record it?
            - We will attempt to record it (no promises)
- Smallpeice 2018
    - Orders
        - Looking at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ux4xMmIJ9lcPlCiNU-EzCzjUzHzQZYKYHzTM3j-X2ik/
