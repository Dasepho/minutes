    - Good luck with GDPR.
    - https://www.nuclino.com/pricing
    - None of these seem that good.
    - Host on Docs instead
        - Have a separate subdomain (i.e. volunteer.sourcebots.org), with netlify.
        - This is nice and central

            - StackEdit: WYSIWYG 
        - Uploading images is a pain.
        - If we do this, it's very important that we have a working 'edit in github' button.

        - We need a CONTRIBUTING file
            - *ACTION POINT*: Henry to look into how Wikipedia handles this.
        -  We need to make docs for what docs we need to create

- Docs
    - /static/docs is an unclear name
    - Issue has been opened

- **Tutorials**
    - Plan to run tutorials on how our systems work, so we can get newbies introduced to the codebase.
        - These need to be pre-planned.
    - *Action Point*: Andy to do an Overview talk next week.

- Dev Environments

    - Vagrant
        - Have some sort of VM/container to spin up.
        - It would be good to have this, to prevent the 'works on my machine' problem.
        - Also reduces pains of joining in.
        - Feels like overkill
    - Nix:
        - Kier has done some experimentation with the nix package manager.
        - Works well with arm
        - install within a 'container thing'.
        - Bus Factor
            - Kier is very knowledgeable
            - Kier is a Nix Dev and thus knows way more than us
            - Kier might be hit by a bus.
    - Docker
        - Can we do this?
            - Docker tutorial session (Soton only): https://www.facebook.com/events/1953234424928004/
    - *Action Point* 
        - Somebody to investigate this

    
- Internal documentation
    - How to create a release
    - How our stack works together (`robotd`, `sb-vision` etc)
    - Internal Memes
    - Create a duplicate version of the docs
    - Put minutes on here?
        - Use minutes repo as submodule?
        - Just a link would work too

- The next release
    - Expected date, no date but Andy is working hard.
    - Expected tickets
    - How's the `opencv` changes going Andy?
        - We should test this on a pi before we ship!
    - Test Runusb
    - Implement Orientation
    - Add docs for Orientation
    - Finish the vision PR.
    - Write changelog
    - Write email
    - Get Pi-image built

- The Cube
    - Still no update from UnionFilms.
        - This is bad. 
        - *Action Point* Charlie to email about Garden Court.
    - Emergency Plan:
        - Change the arena so it can be packed down in 1hr
        - *Action Point* Henry to prod the Sabaticals. Next week.
        - Finish the competition at 2, do prize presentation whilst packing up.
        - *Action Point* Andy to email Max about meeting with them and sorting something out.

- PGP Key Signing
    - This is useful for those who like to sign code on Github
    - https://mikegerwitz.com/papers/git-horror-story
    - It would be good if we could cross-sign each others keys.
        - i.e a keyparty.
    - This software may be of use https://github.com/jaymzh/pius
    - Unless every SB member has a key, and is signed, this adds a cryptographically secure bus-factor
        - Assuming we're forcing updates etc to be shipped with this key
            - Only signed packages can be installed?
            - Perhaps have a SB Key that signs our keys
                - Then only software that is signed by a key that is signed by the SB Key can be installed
    - Advise in _Welcome Pack_ that signing commits is a good idea (although not required)
    - Signing packages is overkill for us
    - We shouldn't block unsigned packages etc

- SlackBot
    - Non-memey room change notifier (in addition to memey one)
        - Auto send an email to the mailing list when it is triggered by authorised users
    - Task poker
        - Poke people to do their tasks so that they don't forget

- There are lots of things Andy needs to hand over,
    - Including passwords
        - https://www.passbolt.com
            - Doesn't support mobile.
            - firefox and chrome support.
    - DNS
    - Mailing list
    - Trello

- Student Robotics Southampton Facebook Page
    - We got spammed
        - Fixed
    - What do?
        - nothing.

- Shipping the new website
    - GDPR issues can be addressed when they come up
        - We should write up what should/shouldn't go on
    - Andy to change some DNS thing.
    - **Decision:** Lets use the netlify website, fix GDPR issues as they come, it's github pages so we can migrate it easily
    - DNS: *Action Point* Jake to send andy the DNS record.
