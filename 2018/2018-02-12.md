# Meeting 12-02-2018 Minutes
- Robogals merger
    
    - Make them another sub group of SCRO / SRO
        - e.g.
        - Sourcebots
        - Student Robotics
        - RoboGals
        - etc
    - They're very interested in merging as they struggle for numbers
    - Opportunity for maybe developing our outreach arm??
        - Out of scope?
        - Do we want to merge with another organisation afetr we just escaped the horrors that is SR?
        - SubGroup?
            - Possibly how SourceBots is a "subgroup" of SCRO
        - Rename SCRO to SRO?
            - Southampton Robotics Outreach
            - Perhaps SURO instead? Southampton University Robotics Outreach
        - SCRO is the pool of volunteers, whilst the two subgroups operate semi-independently
        - They could do mentoring as they have more experience with this whilst we have more experience with technical things
        - Mentor in pairs?
        - *Action Points*: If we agree
            - Make the Wordpress website a SCRO website, and the Netlify website the Sourcebots one?
                - SCRO website: sotonrobo.org?
                - 
            - Maybe rename SCRO to SRO ("Southampton Robotics Outreach"/"Southampton University Robotics Outreach")
            - New mailing lists and facebook group for SCRO
            - Let's see what they say about AGMs
            - Get their members, they need to re-signup.
            - Set up a SRO meeting to discuss this further *Action Point* Andy to speak to RoboGals about the merger.

- SourceBots Slogan:
    > "Eat, Sleep, Build, Compete!"
    - Open up the discussion for other slogans.
    - e.g "Bees"

- Discuss the Favicon:
    - Favicon: ![](https://files.slack.com/files-tmb/T2XQC0VJR-F8VGMKCBA-925c517341/favicons_360.png)

    - *We decided the 2nd one looks best, and that's what we've got.*

- Somebody has claimed the sourcebots.soton.ac.uk domain
    - *ACTION POINT* 
        - ??? to email whois privacy email to see if we can find out who it is
        - Failing this, contact iSolutions to reclaim the domain.

- Medals USB
    - Flesh out details and discuss costing
    - Only give out  one medal per team
        - Otherwise there's issues with large teams
    - The medals could have USB functionality and thus be interfaced with robotd to display as a trophy on subsequent years
    - As we are implementing microcontrollers anyway, it is not a huge amount nire effort to do this?
        - Some microcontrollers have built in USB anyway
        - Thing from labs?
            - But this uses mini USB
        - Discuss with Kier
        - Cover in RGB
        - Mount on old PCBs from WEEE bin
    - What is our actual goal?
        - This seems to be unclear and we need to decide this so that we can define the design criteria.
    - Pre-existing trophy component that we then add to?
        - i.e a shield that we mount the electronic bit onto.
    - * Action Point *
        - Anton to cost this out.

- Do we want a SourceBOTS plaque?
    - As this is the first year, this would be the right time to do this
    - RGB scrolling display.
        - This would mean no engraving costs after the initial year.
    - Returned by the team every year
    - In addition to the medals

- Rename `#dev` on slack 
    - Lots of development
    - Rename to kit dev.
    - Make an #off-topic, #random can be bees.
    - Clean up some channels



- Booking the cube
    - SUSU has started threatening to cancel our booking
    - * Action Point *
        - <angrycaps> WALK IN AND MAKE UNION FILMS DO THINGS </ANGRYCAPS>
    - Another email to Max Hayman telling him of the situation

    - We should consider other venues in case we cannot get the cube.
            - Jubilee Sports Hall?
                - Not done before

- *Shipping the update (finally)!!!!!!!!*
    - RunUSB will blow up if we ask them to use the update mechanism
    - Let's not ship a Version Number today.
    - Last things to do:
        - Update pi-image
        - Document that using the update file won't work for this release
        - We've been waiting too long, lets just ship it.
        - fix and Review email overnight
        - SHIP tomorrow (Tuesday). 
    - Removing ML from vision should go in the next update.

- Git Suggestion
    - [https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
    - Students may be confused when trying to debug as master is not the code they currently are running.
    - [pick something sane](https://twitter.com/redpenblackpen/status/962892473709166592)
    - Add a `develop` branch for our code, make `master` only _stable_ code which is actually shipped to a robot
    - We should add a wiki page on how to do this

- Documenting how volunteers work:
    - We've got to find a nice way of making a wiki
    - Self hosting is *highly* discouraged.
        - We shouldn't rule this out completely
    - * Action Point *
        - Kajetan to research into wiki hosting
            - A small cost could be justified.

- Some issues with the python tutorial, see the Github issue Henry is making.
