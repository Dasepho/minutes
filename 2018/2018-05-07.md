# SourceBots Meeting Minutes
Date: 2018-05-07

## Agenda: SourceBots - 17:30
- *Action Point* Access to SourceBots GitHub organisation for new Director.
    - Should people who are actively involved with development be in the org anyway, regardless of whether they're Director or not?
    - Decision: Yes
- Update Logo to not have Source**BOTS**
    - Make sure the font is converted to shapes
    - *Action Point* Try multiple styles of this at the next meeting
- Image storage
    - Facebook are terrible people
        - They compress the images
        - Decision:
            - Let's use google drive to store images (no compression)
            - (it should automatically move to photos)
            - Use facebook only for publicity stuff.

    - Conclusion: Store in Google Drive, we get at least 15GB free. Upgrading to more storage is a small cost in the future (just upgrade the owner account)
    
- Discussion of new games.
    - Suggestion: Pirate islands but with the markers on adjacent corners.
        - Remove pillars
