- Slack message limit. See #general in Slack where Nick posted.
    - https://sourcebots.slack.com/archives/C2XQGF8QP/p1521420825000046
    - Slack should be considered short-term discussion
        - Persistence doesn't matter then
    - We already have a protocol to fix this, all discussions which should be permanent should be a on the mailing list. See: https://sourcebots.slack.com/files/U2XQV2C74/F9RNXLG00/software_platform_overview

- This could solve the problem with contributing:
    https://cla-assistant.io/
       - CI for CLAs, ensures that the submitter has signed the CLA
       - We should write CLAs for the repos.
           - Some repos will need different CLAs
       - Some projects that use CLAS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement#Users
        
- Discuss when we can populate the volunteer docs
    - After the meeting, we'll arrange a hack day otherwise
    - *ACTION POINT* Create something in the slack for going to the 'how to volunteer' page
  
- `ConnectionRefusedError: [Errno 111] Connection refused` error with boards. Likely related to BoardRunner dying
    - https://github.com/sourcebots/robotd/issues/45
    - Barton and Collyers have had a problem with their servo boards, (Barton has been getting BrokenPipe but it's likely the same issue.)
    - Two solutions:
        - Fix the symptoms
            - If there's an exception in BoardRunner which gets fixed by restarting BoardRunner, we should silently handle it. We should do it anyways.
        - Fix the cause
         - We think it might a connection issue?
                - We can try to reproduce
                    - *Action Point* (Andy): Get a servo to move, read a GPIO
                    - *Action Point* (Jake) Ask Collyers to reproduce it too.
