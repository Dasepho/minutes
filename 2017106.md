# Meeting to discuss Jimmy's email

- Not sure jimmy's right about funding, we're pretty sure we've made a loss at some point. (though he's probably not lying about this year.)
- Because they are planning on getting more than 2-3 committee members, if they pick the right people we could sway their decisions.

Conclusion:

- Encourage people to apply as trustees if they want, we could steer SR in the right direction. 
- But we should continue with our efforts of running a different event.
